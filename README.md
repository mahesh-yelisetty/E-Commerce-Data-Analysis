## Abstract

This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce transaction data using Big Data technologies like Apache Hive, Power BI, and Python-based EDA techniques. The project extracts meaningful insights from large datasets, visualizes business trends, and optimizes decision-making processes.

---

## Dataset

The project uses e-commerce transaction datasets containing details like customer purchases, product categories, sales trends, and revenue generation. The data undergoes cleaning, transformation, and aggregation to derive valuable insights.

---

## Objective

The primary goal is to analyze e-commerce data to:

- Identify sales trends across different product categories.
- Understand customer purchasing behavior.
- Generate interactive visualizations for better business insights.
- Perform data-driven decision-making using Big Data tools.

## Data Processing

### Hive Queries

ðŸ“„ **File:** Hive Queries.docx  
This document contains SQL-like queries for Apache Hive to:

- Clean and preprocess raw data.
- Aggregate sales, revenue, and customer segmentation.
- Perform trend analysis on product demand and seasonal variations.

---

## Visualization
### Power BI Visualization

ðŸ“„ **File:** PowerBi Visualization.docx  
This document provides a step-by-step guide on creating interactive dashboards using Power BI:

- Connecting Power BI to the transformed dataset.
- Creating visualizations such as sales trends, revenue distribution, and customer behavior.
- Extracting insights for data-driven business decisions.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ“„ **File:** r.ipynb  
This Python-based notebook contains EDA scripts using Pandas and Matplotlib:

- Data loading and preprocessing.
- Statistical analysis and feature engineering.
- Visualization of key metrics like sales trends and customer purchase behavior.

---
